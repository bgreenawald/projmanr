\title{Collection of tasks with uncertainty and overlap for tasks in critical path.}
\format{A data frame with 14 rows and 7 variables:
\describe{
  \item{id}{id for the task}
  \item{name}{name of the task}
  \item{duration}{duration of task, in days}
  \item{pred}{id for the task's predecessors as a comma separated string}
  \item{distribution}{Distrubtion for the uncertain task (currently, 
  "triangle", "uniform", and "normal" are supported}
  \item{X}{Depends on the distribution. If "triangle" or "uniform" then this value should be
  the minimum end time for the task. If "normal" then this value is the mean end time for the project
  (all values measured in days)}
  \item{X.1}{Depends on the distribution. If "triangle" or "uniform" then this value should be
  the maximum end time for the task. If "normal" then this value is the standard deviation of
   end time for the project (all values measured in days)}
  \item{X.2}{If "triangle" then this value is the most likely value for the end
  time (measured in days)}
